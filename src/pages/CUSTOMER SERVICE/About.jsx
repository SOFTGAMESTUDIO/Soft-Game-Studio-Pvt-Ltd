      At <strong>SOFT GAME STUDIO</strong>, our mission is rooted in the belief that education should be 
      accessible, practical, and inspiring. We understand the challenges students and self-learners face 
      when diving into the world of programming — from confusing syntax to overwhelming concepts. That’s 
      why we strive to simplify complex ideas and deliver them in a way that feels both logical and exciting.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 text-xs font-normal  md:text-sm ">
      Through our curated notes, real-world examples, and hands-on coding projects, we aim to build a 
      foundation that not only helps learners pass exams but also prepares them to solve real-world problems. 
      Our platform is designed with the student in mind — whether you're preparing for a semester test, 
      developing a final year project, or simply curious about how to build your first app.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 text-xs font-normal  md:text-sm ">
      In addition to written tutorials, we’re expanding into <strong>interactive video lectures</strong>, 
      step-by-step programming challenges, and personalized guidance — all with the goal of keeping the 
      learning process engaging and community-driven.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-8 text-xs font-normal  md:text-sm ">
      Our long-term mission is to create a space where learning to code doesn’t feel like a task — it feels 
      like a journey worth taking. One where every student, regardless of background, has the tools and 
      support to succeed in technology and beyond.
